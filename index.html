            <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-3">Good News!</h2>
            <h3 class="mb-5" style="text-align: center;">God has provided a way for us to go to heaven!</h3>
            <h3>1. Admit that you are a sinner and need to be saved.</h3>
            <p>
              (No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still fall short.)
              For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
              - Romans 3:23
            </p>
              
            <h3>2. Realize the penalty for sin, repent and be willing to turn from your sin.</h3>
            <p>
              (There is punishment for sin. The penalty for our sin is eternal punishment in a place called Hell.)
              For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Romans 6:23
              And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: - Hebrews 9:27
            </p>
              
              <h3>3. Believe that Christ died for you on the Cross of Calvary.</h3>
              <p>
                God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:6-8
              Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - John 14:6
              </p>
              
            <h3>4. Receive Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour into your heart and life through prayer.</h3>
              <p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9
              Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. - John 5:24
              -Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
              For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. - Romans 10:13
            </p>
              
          <h3>Pray and ask The Lord to save YOU</h3>
              <p><strong>Don't just read this, pray it from your heart with all sincerity:</strong><br>
              
              <em>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner. I know that I need you. I believe that you died on the cross for me. Forgive me of my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life to you. I receive you as my Lord and Saviour, come into my life and save me. Thank you for what you did on the cross for me. In Your Name I humble ask... Amen.”</em>
